## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

As part of standard development practices, various levels of testing to encompass additional scope items will be taken.  As such, the following depths of testing will be done - each test strategy below will include a brief description of what the test focus shall be, any potential problems and the responsible party.

* **Unit testing**: Unit-level testing is key for early development practices, ensuring regular code maintenance is done properly and good for low-level testing of code.  Unit testing targets for key aspects such as code coverage, proper exception testing as well as a proper balance of positive and negative testing.  This level of testing will be handled by each developer within the project, generally within their own workload as part of their normal deliverables.

* **Integration testing**: Integration testing allows multiple units to interact with one another.  A simple example of this is as follows:

  > Unit: **Key** class, used to authenticate an entity
  > Unit: **Lock** class, used to verify access to a secure entity
  >
  > Integration: Testing of how the **Key** class interacts with the **Lock** class.

  Similar to the unit testing above, integration testing has many facets.  One key facet to this strategy is positive and negative testing of the integration between different units.  As the system is developed, it will fall upon the individual developers to ensure that their units interact properly with other units when integrated together, utilizing the class design diagram to drive realistic cases.

* **System testing**: System-level testing is the "full sign-off" of the developed system.  Generally, the system-level test suite comprises of full end-to-end tests that flush out any high-level issues and is considered the most "customer-facing" approach to testing.  All members of the team will be involved with system-level testing, allowing multiple backgrounds and inputs to ensure all levels of the application are tested thoroughly.

* **Regression testing**: Regression testing ensures that the system maintains its state between releases and revisions, providing confidence that regular maintenance, featuren enhancements and defect fixes do not introduce negative behaviors into existing functionality.  Generally, regression testing shall be executed by the developer introducing the new code into the system but based on size, scope and time limitations it may include other developers or resources as well.

### 1.2 Test Selection

Test selection will mostly be driven by the level of testing being done at any specific time.  In general, the closer the tester is to the code, the closer to white-box testing they can get.

> Unit -- Integration -- System -- Regression
>
> White-Box -------- Hybrid -------- Black-Box



Understanding the above is key to driving the test selection process: unit testing and integration testing will rely more on lower-level testing methods and functions while higher-level testing, such as regression testing, will focus more on user workflows and use cases.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

One key factor in ensuring test quality is that the tests should generally either document the behavior of the units under test or integrations between units.  Going from the lowest level of testing to the highest, tests generally should:

1. Exercise proper boundary testing for functional pieces of units
2. Expose known exception throws to ensure integrations are handling the exceptions properly
3. Ensure the system behaves in-line with expectations outlined in either the use case document, requirements and/or development decisions

As the application continues to develop, assessments of test quality will be an on-going process to ensure redundant or inadequate tests are removed from the test bed.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Defect tracking will utilize the Github Issues tracker, allowing developers to tie defects to code fixes at a specific commit level.  By using the Github tracker, defects can be assigned to or pulled by individual developers.  With this interface, defects can also be labeled and prioritized for efficiency and visibility.  

Defects will be stored at the following location: https://github.gatech.edu/gt-omscs-se-2018summer/6300Summer18Team55/issues

### 1.5 Technology

Given the time and resource constraints of the team members, testing will be focused on **manual testing** for user interface and general system-level application testing while lower level testing will focus on **automated testing**, including JUnit and similar frameworks.  

While automated testing is preferred, manual testing allows more development time on functional enhancements, defect fixes as well as requirements review.  Automated testing is a separate discipline and requires a more up-front investment of time and resources.
