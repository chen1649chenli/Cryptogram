## 1 Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an Android app about cryptogram game for our customer, Boston Towers. In this App, players can practice solving cryptograms and compare their progress.

## 2 Process Description

After team meeting discussion, we decide to use a Rational Unified Process (RUP) in this project. We think this is a good fit because we are going to iterate our documents as well as code through out each individual phase.

- Business modeling
    - Use business use cases to model the business processes.  
    - Entrance criteria: The requirement/problem statement.
    - Exit criteria: A clear business model.


- Requirements.
    - Perform business analysis to do requirement engineering.  
    - Entrance criteria:
      - business modeling is completed
      - clients start to share requirement
    - Exit criteria: Requirements are clearly documented.


- Design
    - Create a design model that includes using architectural models, component models, deployment model, class models and UI design. Create testing document to define testing cases. Use cases are analyzed and created.  
    - Entrance criteria: requirement is clearly documented.
    - Exit criteria: Use case model, design model documents and test plan are delivered.


- Implementation/Coding
    - The java code and xml configuration files for components/classes in the system are implemented.
    - Entrance criteria: design activity is completed.
    - Exit criteria: application is developed.


- Testing
    - Testing process is embedded in the iterative development process. There are unit testing, integration testing and user manual testing.
    - Entrance criteria: start of the implementation activity.
    - Exit criteria: All component and the whole system are sufficiently tested.

- Deployment
    - A product is release,  and all codes and documents are pushed to GaTech team github account.
    - Entrance criteria: all tests are passed.
    - Exit criteria: Final release of the App.

- Change management
    - The process manages changes to the App
    - Entrance criteria: new user requirement.
    - Exit criteria: deployment change to the production.
